# üçï Hello üçï


I am glad to welcome you to my pet project - [ PizzaReact ](https://medyanenko.github.io/PizzaReact/).

## On this page you can:

-filter products by name;
-sort by categories and other parameters (popularity, price, alphabet);
-add and remove items to the shopping cart;
-calculate order amount;
-navigate pages using pagination.

## During development:

- Created components, pages, sorting, searching, pagination, filtering, popup windows, etc.;
- Interacted with the server part, send requests to the backend (mockApi);
- Developed page navigation without reloading;
- Created a global data store for the entire application;
- Wrote strongly typed code in TypeScript;
- Worked with LocalStorage to store site settings;
- used Lazy Loading (lazy loading) + debounce (optimization for pizza search);
- Made adaptive layout;
- Deploy the application to the Internet.
