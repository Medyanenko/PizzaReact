# üçï Hello üçï


I am glad to welcome you to my pet project - [ PizzaReact ](https://medyanenko.github.io/PizzaReact/).

## On this page you can:

- filter products by name;
- sort by categories and other parameters (popularity, price, alphabet);
- add and remove items to the shopping cart;
- calculate order amount;
- navigate pages using pagination.

## During development:

- Created components, pages, sorting, searching, pagination, filtering, popup windows, etc.;
- Interacted with the server part, send requests to the backend (mockApi);
- Developed page navigation without reloading;
- Created a global data store for the entire application;
- Wrote strongly typed code in TypeScript;
- Worked with LocalStorage to store site settings;
- used Lazy Loading (lazy loading) + debounce (optimization for pizza search);
- Made adaptive layout;
- Deploy the application to the Internet.

## Used in development:

- ReactJS 18;
- TypeScript;
- Redux Toolkit (data storage / pizzas);
- React Router v6 (navigation);
- Axios + Fetch (sending a request to the backend); 
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo, etc);
- Prettier (code formatting);
- CSS-Modules / SCSS (stylization);
- React Content Loader (skeleton); 
- React Pagination (pagination); 
- Lodash.Debounce (function to prevent debounce);
- Code Splitting (react lazy load).
